# Novel Scaling Laws for MoE Architectures: A Theoretical Analysis

## Abstract

This paper presents fundamental scaling laws governing the relationship between expert granularity, cache efficiency, and bus bandwidth in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model architectures. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, I demonstrate that increasing expert count while decreasing individual expert size can theoretically lead to exponentially improved cache efficiency, even under bandwidth-constrained scenarios. This relationship is governed by specific scaling laws that I derive. The theoretical framework suggests that models with smaller but more numerous experts could achieve superior performance while significantly reducing memory requirements, potentially enabling efficient deployment of trillion-parameter models without requiring full VRAM residency.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid advancement of large language models has driven hardware requirements to unprecedented levels, particularly in VRAM capacity. While MoE architectures improve parameter efficiency through sparse activation, conventional deployment assumes model parameters must reside entirely in accelerator memory. This assumption has led to costly solutions involving GPU meshing or reduced-quality edge deployments.

Recent work by Skliar et al. (2024) demonstrated that cache-aware routing strategies can significantly improve MoE inference efficiency. Building on these insights, this paper presents a theoretical framework that predicts and explains the relationship between expert granularity and system performance.

### 1.1 Core Hypothesis

This work proposes that the relationship between expert count, size, and cache efficiency follows specific scaling laws that can be theoretically derived. The central hypothesis is that increasing the number of experts while reducing their individual size leads to exponentially improved cache efficiency, governed by the relationship:

```math
\text{Performance Gain} \propto \frac{N_{total}^{\alpha}}{s_{exp}^{\beta}}
```

where $N_{total}$ is the total number of experts, $s_{exp}$ is the size of each expert, and $\alpha$, $\beta$ are architecture-specific constants derived in this work.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Fundamental Scaling Laws

Building on the work of He (2024) regarding expert scaling in MoE models, this paper derives a comprehensive set of scaling laws that govern the relationship between expert configuration and system performance.

For a given layer with $C_{exp}$ experts needed per forward pass, the framework defines:

- $N$ as the number of experts per layer
- $s_{exp}$ as the size of each expert in bytes
- $bus$ as the available bus bandwidth (bytes/second)
- $t_{exp}$ as the time to process a single expert
- $P_{cached}$ as the fraction of total experts present in cache
- $P_{miss}$ as the probability of a cache miss

The fundamental relationship between these parameters can be expressed as:

```math
P_{miss} = (1 - P_{cached})^{C_{exp}}
```

To account for expert loading time, the effective miss penalty is defined as:

```math
x_{miss} = P_{miss} \times \left(\frac{s_{exp}}{bus}\right)
```

### 2.2 Cache Efficiency Analysis and Scaling Constants

The probability of finding necessary experts in cache improves exponentially with increased expert count, following:

```math
P_{hit} = 1 - (1 - P_{cached})^{C_{exp}}
```

This relationship leads to the first key scaling law:

```math
\text{Cache Efficiency} \propto \exp(k \cdot N_{total})
```

where $k$ is a system-specific constant determined by memory hierarchy latencies.

The constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in the scaling law arise from two key relationships:

1. $\alpha$ (Expert Count Scaling Factor):
   - Represents how performance scales with increased expert count
   - Derived from cache coherency overhead:
```math
     \alpha = \log_2(\frac{t_{cache\_miss}}{t_{cache\_hit}})
```
   - Where $t_{cache\_miss}$ and $t_{cache\_hit}$ are the respective latencies

2. $\beta$ (Expert Size Penalty Factor):
   - Captures how larger experts impact bandwidth utilization
   - Calculated from memory system characteristics:
```math
     \beta = \frac{\log(bus_{bandwidth})}{\log(cache_{bandwidth})}
```
   - Reflects the penalty of moving larger experts through the memory hierarchy

These constants can be theoretically predicted for a given architecture by analyzing:
- Memory hierarchy latencies
- Bus bandwidths between different memory tiers
- Cache coherency protocol overhead
- Memory controller queuing characteristics

### 2.3 Bandwidth Utilization Model

Following ProMOE's findings (Song et al., 2024), bandwidth utilization is modeled as:

```math
\text{Effective Bandwidth} = bus \cdot (1 - P_{miss}) + \text{cache bandwidth} \cdot P_{hit}
```

This leads to the second key scaling law:

```math
\text{Throughput} = \frac{N_{active}}{t_{proc} + x_{miss}}
```

where $N_{active}$ is the number of active experts per forward pass.
